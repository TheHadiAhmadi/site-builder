## Plugin system
- [ ] each function has an identifier and User friendly name + description
- [ ] each function should have definition which shows available props
- [ ] add new field type named Function which user can choose which function should bind to the prop
- [ ] for example for carList I set 'cars.load' as function and in renderModule we have access to all functions
- [ ] if module has onLoad prop, call that function. (body, query, params...) as parameter and props as result
- [ ] load functions have enum type 'load'
- [ ] other functions have enum type 'action'
- [ ] actions should be used within forms and loads when rendering modules.
- [ ] AI Should know about available functions 
- [ ] Each js file can have one or more function. should be exported.
- [ ] Function management (Upload zip/js file), then reload project.
- [ ] Enable/Disable function feature
- [ ] UnInstall function
- [ ] <form method="POST" action="contact_us.send_message"></form> // action example
- [ ] module: { id: string, definitionId: string, load: 'cars.load', props: {}, links: {}}  // load example
